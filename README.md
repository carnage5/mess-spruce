Mess-Spruce
Team Name - Team-14

Mentor Name - Vijit Kumar

Team members - Abishek D H. Anusree Pratham Bhat Kiran

Problem Statement -

Disciplining the hostel mess system which is currently suffering from a lot of chaos in terms of checking mess allocation and payment tracking system.

Existing Solutions -
There's an existing mess app called space basic , provided by the hostel to select the mess of your choice on a first come first serve basis and keep track of whether you are eating at the mess you selected and were allocated. Coupon based system for payment.

Your Solution -
App name - mess spruce
Our solution aims to make the whole process more efficient and reduce human effort , by eliminating choke points caused by them. Instead of the current system where each student generates a QR code and is scanned by a single mess worker ,which often causes long queues and holds up the line, we plan to introduce a unique QR code for each mess , and the student can scan those QRs and on scanning them , the app confirms whether they were allocated that mess or not . Mess allocations happen at the beginning of every month. We also are going to add a payment tracking system, instead of the current coupon system which is tiresome and inefficient.

What we plan to complete in ICEB4 -
We plan to develop a basic working model of an app that people can use to manage their mess activities with ease, with most of our core functions working well.
